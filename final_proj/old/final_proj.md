# Final Project

Requirements:

- 5-10 minute presentation on a relevant paper to your project
- half-page project proposal
- 15-20 minute final presentation
- final report
	- submitting a single jupyter notebook is acceptable, but it should be well documented
	- no minimum length, but do something cool!


This course is focused on interpretability, but final projects in other alignment-related areas are acceptable as long as they have a strong mathematical component (i.e. mathematically modelling things for governance/policy research)
